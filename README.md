# Health App & Device Development Using Java & C++
<br>

**Overview**
<br>
This project aims to develop a comprehensive health monitoring system consisting of a hardware device and an Android application. The device, built using Arduino and C++, is designed to collect data from various health sensors (oxymeter, Max3010, and pedometer). The collected data is then transmitted to an Android application developed using Java and on LSD screen od device. The application stores and analyzes the data, providing users with valuable insights into their health metrics.

**Hardware Component**
<br>
* **Arduino Board:** The microcontroller responsible for controlling the sensors and communicating with the Android application.
* **Sensors:**
  - Oxymeter
  - Glucose Monitor
  - Pedometer
* **Communication Module:** (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) for wireless data transmission.
<br>

**Software Components**
<br>
* **Android Application:** Developed using Java, this app acts as the user interface, receives data from the device, stores it in an AWS database, and provides visualizations and analysis.
* **C++ Code:** The code running on the Arduino board, responsible for sensor readings, data processing, data visulaization and communication with the Android app.
<br>

**Testing and Validation**

* **Title:** Smart And Non-Invasive Diabetic Control System
* **Abstract:** Mellitus Diabetes is affecting around 537 million adults aged 20 to 79. By 2030, the overall aggregate of diabetics is expected to reach 643 million, and by 2045, it will spread to 783 million. Advancement in Science has not yet given proper medical treatment to this large population of mankind to get rid of this merciless killer disease. But by continuous blood glucose monitoring and following an appropriate diet and exercise plans this cruel disease can be managed effectively. Traditionally used invasive method of diabetes monitoring is stressful and infectious. Glucose level monitoring is also dependent on oxygen saturation, as oxidative phosphorylation is the heart of the sensory system. Cardiovascular is the leading cause of such a high mortality rate due to diabetes. For smart continuous monitoring of glucose, it is necessary to keep an eye on oxygen saturation and pulse rate. In this study, we are suggesting a cost-effective and accurate device for glucose, oxygen saturation, and pulse rate prediction based on photoplethysmography technique. In this device, an accelerometer is also installed which not only counts the steps but also gives the estimation of distance traveled and calories burnt out. For online monitoring of devices, an android application is also designed which gives a vast assortment of meals plan according to season along with real-time monitoring and storing of data. To share health statistics with the doctor an Amazon Web Server is also utilized in this work. The Parkes Error Grid Analysis shows that the prediction of glucose level is 99.61% accurate with a mean absolute error of 3.989%. The correlation confidence for the actual and predicted oxygen saturation level or pulse rate is 0.809 and 0.839 respectively while the coefficient of determination for this association is 79.38% and 83.91% respectively. The average mean difference of the proposed device for steps, the distance measured and calories burnt out is 7.47, 6.53, and 1.43 respectively with the standard deviation of 3.81, 4.96 and 1.11.
